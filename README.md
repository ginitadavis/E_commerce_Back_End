# Description

This project consists of an E-commerce Back End website. I worked with Express.js API and used Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database. I was provided with a seeds database, and I built the models category, product, tag, and productTag. I also created the routes GET all, GET by id, POST, PUT, and DELETE. I used Insomnia to see the results of the user request of create, update, and delete data from the database.
